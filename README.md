# Big Idea
Analyzing Human Face Emotions

# Objectives:
- To develop a deep learning model that can recognize emotions from facial expressions.
- To evaluate the performance of the model using the CK+ dataset.
- To achieve a decent accuracy in recognizing emotions from facial
expressions.

# Methods & Technologies:
- Pre-processing of the proposed dataset to prepare it for training and testing.
- Design and implementation of a CNN model.
- Training of the CNN model on the pre-processed CK+ dataset.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as epochs vs accuracy & epochs vs loss.

# Outcomes:
- A deep learning model capable of recognizing emotions from facial expressions with a higher accuracy.
- A detailed report summarizing the results of the project, including the methodology, technologies used, and evaluation metrics.
- A demo of the working system, showcasing its ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions.

# Results
- The custom CNN model achieves a test accuracy of 74.62% on the CK+ dataset. 
- The results indicate that the model has effectively learned to recognize facial expressions. 
- Further improvements to the model can be explored to achieve even higher accuracy rates.
