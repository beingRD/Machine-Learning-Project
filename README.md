# CPSC-5616 Machine Learning Project, Winter 2023
Project aimed at recognizing emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).We are writing this to propose a 8-week project aimed at recognizing emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to use deep learning techniques to develop a system that can accurately identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger based on facial features.

# Objectives:
- To develop a deep learning model that can recognize emotions from facial expressions.
- To evaluate the performance of the model using the proposed dataset.
- To achieve an accuracy of at least 80% in recognizing emotions from facial
expressions.

# Methods & Technologies:
- Pre-processing of the proposed dataset to prepare it for training and testing.
- Design and implementation of a CNN model.
- Training of the CNN model on the pre-processed Proposed dataset.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Outcomes:
- A deep learning model capable of recognizing emotions from facial expressions with a higher accuracy.
- A detailed report summarizing the results of the project, including the methodology, technologies used, and evaluation metrics.
- A demo of the working system, showcasing its ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions.
